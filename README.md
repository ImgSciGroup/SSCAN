# SSCAN: Novel Spatial-Spectral Channel Attentions Neural Network for LCCD With Remote Sensing Images
Land cover change detection (LCCD) with remote sensing images plays an important role in observing the Earthâ€™s surface change, and the spatial-spectral channels attention mechanism has become attractive in recent years. This paper proposed a Spatial-Spectral Channels Attentions Neural Network (SSCAN) for achieving LCCD using remote sensing images. In the proposed SSCAN, different from the traditional methods, to enhance the changed area and inhibit the unchanged area, the spatial channel attention module (SCAM) and convolution block attention module (CBAM) are employed to process the pre-event and post-event image, respectively. Moreover, a simple yet effect Batch size Dynamic Adjustment (BDA) strategy is promoted to train the proposed SSCAN for guaranteeing convergence to the global optima of the objective function. Experiments based on comparing seven cognate and state-of-art methods well demonstrated that the proposed network has some advantages in accelerating the network convergence speed, reinforcing the learning efficiency, and improving the performance of LCCD.
